# Why SOBO

* Solitude. Typically only 10% of all PCT hikers choose to walk south. Compare that to the 50 permits issued for each day during the Northbound hiking season. You will see fewer people on your Southbound hike. Personally, that was precisely what I was looking for. For me, connecting with nature is a highly personal and individualist experience. A crowded trail would detract from that experience. I certainly wasn't looking for a party atmosphere.
* Competing for resources. When arriving in a small town, you'll have less concern about finding an available hotel room. You won't have to worry about finding a free space at a campsite.
* Washington. Many people decide to end their thru-hike within the first month, for all kinds of reasons that are within or outside their control. If that is the case for you, at least you will have experience Washington, one of the most scenic sections of the trail. And the beauty begins right away - the first 30 miles from Harts Pass to the border consistently rank high on people's most favourite trail sections list.
* A cool desert section. Going NOBO through the desert is a gruelling experience. I don't think I would want to be walking in 100+ degree heat.
* Culture

## NOBO CROWDS

In recent years the PCTA has released 50 permits per day throughout the the Northbound season. In 2018, 4500 Northbound thru-hike permits were issued. That is in contrast to 491 Southbound permits for the same year.

The PCT going NOBO is crowded. The popularity of the trail has skyrocketed in the years since Wild was released in cinemas. Personally, this detracts from the experience I set out for when I did my hike: adventure, independence, self sufficiency, connection with nature, peacefulness. I think this issue for me is the defining one on which direction you should choose. I don't want to be squeezing 15 people into a 4-person tent site. I don't want to be hurrying into town early to get the few remaining hotel rooms. I don't want to be part of a herd.

This is a personal preference, it's not a value judgement on those who are looking for something different. 



# PREPARATION
## FITNESS PREPARATION

The advice over at PCTSouthbound.com is that fitness preparation should be your number 1 concern leading up to your hike. I agree with this sentiment. The more in shape you are when starting at Harts Pass, the better experience you will have in the first few weeks of your hike.

However, I want to qualify this advice a little. I found myself getting anxious about not having done enough training as my start date approached. Making time to train wasn't easy when I had to move out of my apartment, put all my things in storage, complete and handover work at my job, and get all my resupply sorted! I felt I was behind in preparation, and I felt guilty about that.

This was not helpful! I was sacrificing my mental wellbeing. 

Take an honest look at your physical condition. Are you someone who integrates fitness and activity into their life already? Do you run / walk / lift / climb / etc in your regular life? If you do, then I feel like you can make up any fitness gap on the trail itself. Any extra preparation you do is a bonus.

If you live an inactive life and / or find cardiovascular exercise difficult, then I think fitness preparation is incredibly important and should be absolutely your number one priority pre-trail. You're going to be thrown into the deep end on a SOBO hike.

## INJURY MANAGEMENT
If you have any pre-existing injuries that you suspect may reoccur on the trail, THIS should be your primary concern. Injuries, particularly stress-related such as shin splints, plantar fasciitis, or anything achilles related are hugely prevalent on the trail and commonly end people's adventures barely after they started. 

The trail is going to beat your body into a pulp in the first month. It's going to break down before it has time to adapt. 

Whatever you can do ahead of time: specific exercises, stretching, PT, conditioning or whatever it is that works for you, do it!

## KEEPING PERSPECTIVE
My biggest day on trail was 40 miles. If you told me before hand that I would do a 40 mile day, I would have laughed at you. During preparation, I was stressed out at the idea of even doing 25's each day, a goal I knew I would need to hit in order to make it to the end.

Don't stress. Your body will adapt, you will achieve things you never imagined possible. Your benchmarks of what you consider a long day will change. You'll tap into a source of strength that perhaps you've never used before, that will propel you forward each day. This is one of the greatest rewards of the trail, and it's waiting for you!

Which brings me to my final thought...

## MENTAL PREPARATION
This is so largely underrated, and something I hadn't considered much until I read the wonderful book Pacific Crest Trials. I would thoroughly reccommend it to anyone. 

At the two ends of the spectrum: you might begin your trip feeling like you're finally achieving your destiny. Like you were born to do this. That all your life decisions have led you to this wonderful moment that is happening _right now_, this is your moment, your progress is ordained and undeniable.

On the other hand, you might be racked with nervousness and anxiety. Full of doubt. Can I make it? What the f**k am I thinking, this is insane! I can't do this. I haven't prepared enough. I'm foregoing comfort, friends, an easy life, certainty, all to be out here.

Likely, you are somewhere between these two poles. It is my strong opinion that the closer you are to the former, the better your experience is going to be, and the more chance you have at success. 

Dealing with anxiety is far from an easy thing. Each person needs to approach it differently. Is there something you can do to take the weight off your mind? 

Hundreds of people have come before you, successfully completed their hike, and want to channel this advice to you: it's going to be great! You're going to be fine. It's going to work out, even if you might not see it yet.
